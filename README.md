# Game of Life

This program was not designed to be publicly used. However, if you want to run some simulations, the only file that you need to open is `GameOfLife.ipynb`. In this file, you will find a config block that allow you to modifiy the parameters of the simulation. After that, there is one block per analysis that you can edit, delete or add ones if you want.
